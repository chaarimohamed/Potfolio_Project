  * EDA : Effectively visualized different plots(histogram,pie chart,correlation heatmap) to better understand our features.
  * Dimentionality reduction : Extracted the most important variables that have most impact on the target variable.
  * Feature engennering : Used different types of scaling to get optimal results.
  * Model evaluation: Achieved a 97 % Accuraccy using Logistic regression .
